# For Each

Apply a command to multiple files and directories with **ForEach**

## How it works

 - Takes a path to directory optionally with a mask
 - Applies command **for each** file or directory in this path

## Examples

```bash
# Remove all temporary files from home
foreach ~/*.tmp rm

# List all files and directories in current directory
foreach . echo

# List current Git branch for all projects
foreach --directory ~/projects "cd <file> && git status | grep branch"
```

## Options

Option | Description
--- | ---
**-d, --directory** | Apply command only to directories
**-f, --file** | Apply command only to files
**--include-dot-directories** | Look inside directories with names started with dot - ".git", ".idea" etc. Ignoring these directories by default.
**--include-directories-ignored-by-git** | Do not use ".gitignore" rules. By default we skip all directories mentioned in ".gitignore".
